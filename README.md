# Alcohol Sensing Auto Engine Lock using Arduino

## Overview

Driving under the influence of alcohol is a major cause of road accidents and fatalities. To address this critical issue, I have developed an innovative solution â€“ the "Alcohol Sensing Auto Engine Lock" system using Arduino.

## Features

- **Real-time Alcohol Detection**: The system uses an alcohol sensor to detect alcohol levels in the driver's breath in real-time.
- **Adjustable Threshold**: The threshold for alcohol detection can be customized to meet legal limits or personal preferences.
- **Engine Lock Mechanism**: If the alcohol reading exceeds the set threshold, the engine remains locked, preventing the vehicle from starting.
- **LED Feedback**: Visual feedback through LEDs indicates the system's status.
- **Safety First**: Promotes responsible and safe driving habits.


## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Alcohol sensor module
- Relay module
- LEDs and resistors
- Jumper wires
- Power supply

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Appropriate Arduino libraries for sensor and relay control

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yugandhar2k1/Alcohol-Sensing-Project.git`
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the project file.
3. Install the necessary libraries for the alcohol sensor and relay module.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
2. Set the desired alcohol threshold in the Arduino code.
3. Power on the system.
4. If the alcohol level is below the threshold, the engine can be started.
5. If the alcohol level exceeds the threshold, the engine remains locked, and LEDs indicate the status.
